        <h2>Take time</h2>

        When would you like to schedule a followup
        <br>We are booked out
        <br>How's the 5th of November
        <br>I could do 4:15
        <br>
        <br>That was the last conversation before
        <br>They took my vitals and made me wait
        <br>The results were in
        <br>But no one would tell me
        <br>
        <br>I scrolled, past this past that
        <br>Dow down 100, S&P up 15
        <br>Inflation again, rates amiss
        <br>How long has it been
        <br>
        <br>Taking the pen, cap off and on
        <br>It's a good thing my afternoon was clear
        <br>Swipe back up, no messages
        <br>Swipe left, swipe right
        <br>
        <br>Deep breath
        <br>It really is taking a long time
        <br>I'm used to waiting
        <br>But come on
        <br>
        <br>Still and shocked, knew it would be something
        <br>Like this
        <br>Fuck
        <br>Damnit
        <br>
        <br>You're all set, do you want a reminder card
        <br>Just the copay is due today
        <br>I'm ok, I put it in my phone
        <br>Have a good day
        <br>
        <br>I don't have anything to say to you right now
        <br>It's not <em>your</em> problem
        <br>I'll fucking figure it out
        <br>I'm sorry
        <br>
        <br>The sun shone brighter that day
        <br>Witnessed the blue again
        <br>The way the cloud wisped across
        <br>No fluff, no bubble, just lines of faint
        <br>
        <br>The car scorched hot, burning my hands
        <br>Metal clicking into its lock
        <br>Humid breath against my body
        <br>Just, just … is it though
        <br>
        <br>A tear fell down my cheek
        <br>Or was it a bead of sweat
        <br>I lost my keys in my hand
        <br>And turned over the ignition
        <br>
        <br>Turned over
        <br>Turned over
        <br>
        <br>The car exploded into life, full air
        <br>Blew
        <br>Windows down and vents turned
        <br>Exhausted of excuses today
        <br>
        <br>Back up, pull ahead
        <br>And I went
        <br>One more day, to think, or try not to
        <br>In this slowly dying body of mine

        <h2>Sustain</h2>
        <p>
            We walked through those heavy doors<br>
            With a care on our mind<br>
            Slipping on the entry mat<br>
            Driving across the slick and grime<br>
            <br>
            The umbrella stand to the left<br>
            The hat rack just beside<br>
            Those small offerings to greet our guest<br>
            Stay as long as you like<br>
            <br>
            Swept up in the atmosphere<br>
            Cool wood tones and jolly tunes<br>
            What is this place we landed<br>
            Will there be candy or wine<br>
            <br>
            A group we are not, we are something stronger<br>
            A stiff drink, a double, neat please<br>
            That's how we go together<br>
            Dressed up, no shorts, your slippers off<br>
            <br>
            Drip down your legs with my touch<br>
            How smooth your skin, subtle, supple<br>
            Hold my hand, caresses over the knuckles<br>
            My eye following the seams of your dress<br>
            <br>
            We floated out from the storm, into this paradise<br>
            Found each other again, in this paradise<br>
            You aren't really here, in this paradise<br>
            Just me, alone<br>
            <br>
            in<br>
            this<br>
            paradise<br>

        <h2>Black</h2>
        <p>
            Will you come in that black dress
            <br>And drink a cup of black coffee
            <br>Against the view of seaside reflection
            <br>And shield ourselves in warmth
            <br>
            <br>There is a little place, under a bridge
            <br>That serves the black beans of bliss
            <br>Poured into our cup, fuel for conversation
            <br>Let us go and meet, don't speak
            <br>
            <br>A table in the back, velvet lined
            <br>Cushioned and cozy, you first
            <br>Laughter easy currency, a rich man
            <br>Dopamine floods and butterflies
            <br>
            <br>She told me the story of her mother
            <br>Flying out against a city night
            <br>Up to something better, practitioner of dance
            <br>An old story of medicine and heart
            <br>
            <br>How enraptured am I
            <br>My ego on display
            <br>Aware am I
            <br>My
            <br>
            <br>I spoke of my father, corporate pillar
            <br>Saturday sessions, the suit left to dry
            <br>The evening brought music, cabled
            <br>Amplified, projected out into the alcohol soaked wood
            <br>
            <br>Splash, crash, twirled, boom, brush
            <br>Pentatonic forces driving forward
            <br>Past the spectrum to single a source
            <br>The blues, beat up, black, and rusty
            <br>
            <br>I lost you for a bit, perhaps ignored
            <br>Purposefully put you out, you stranger
            <br>Take away your power, remove your frets
            <br>Unplug your instrument, wield no more
            <br>
            <br>How the attention roars back, back from the set
            <br>The dam opens and floods, mud first
            <br>Smoky eyes, bud light cans, bar stool plans
            <br>Don't slip now, no balance found, too much
            <br>
            <br>Drive on, across that bridge, leave her there
            <br>Tears will surely fall, anger then rage,
            <br>Question me a thousand ways
            <br>And no such answers for the ride
            <br>
            <br>The tape will turn over, reverse
            <br>I like this side for a time
            <br>Let it ride,
            <br>Let it ride

        She screamed at the loss
        <br>Torn, cut, mangled, distraught
        <br>Her child was gone
        <br>And left only empty arms
        <br>
        <br>A quiet stillness to the night before
        <br>Hot cocoa flowing free, laughter
        <br>Flickering candle lighting up the kitchen
        <br>Not so much, temperance, slow down
        <br>O, I suppose, she gives in to giggle and joy
        <br>
        <br>Shattered sparklers on the floor
        <br>Green tinted, angular, dispersed
        <br>Flow of red cracked in the shield
        <br>Frantic, confused, deadened, and shocked
        <br>
        <br>The smoke from the extinguished candle swirled above
        <br>What a good night, what fun was had
        <br>He's just so good in that movie
        <br>God I love him
        <br>
        <br>Are you alright, are you ok?
        <br>Who are you trying to call?
        <br>Just stay still
        <br>Don't move
        <br>
        <br>Let's read a bedtime story, or a show
        <br>Snuggle up so we can be warm together
        <br>Curled under this blanket
        <br>Want to play the stuffy game?
        <br>
        <br>We are going to get you out
        <br>Just hang in there a little longer
        <br>Help is on the way
        <br>…
        <br>
        <br>Just one more? This is the last
        <br>You need your rest
        <br>I promise
        <br>Oookay
        <br>
        <br>I don't remember much after that
        <br>Fractured images of black and white
        <br>Handcuffed and screaming still
        <br>That pain, we need you to sober up
        <br>
        <br>Child, are you okay?
        <br>She smiles, blinks, and flashes those eyes
        <br>Those bright blue eyes, those long lashes
        <br>I'm happy you are here

        <br>Will you let your hair go gray
        <br>And let it drip down your neck like pearls
        <br>Turning and curling to frame your gaze
        <br>A work, never finished, a state, grace
        <br>
        <br>Will you join me on the balcony
        <br>And soak up the last sun rays
        <br>The cold night creeping in
        <br>The desert wind, fragmented sand
        <br>
        <br>Will you let down your guard, that shoulder stress
        <br>Falling in with the pressure of my hand
        <br>Will you be safe, a sleep undisturbed
        <br>You'll know no love like, a thirst quenched
        <br>
        <br>The compass dial, the sun, streams of satellites above
        <br>Help navigate our journey in, if we step
        <br>Your shawled silhouette, whispers of hair
        <br>Unravel in the blistering invisible force
        <br>
        <br>The bed lies ahead, comfort all but promised
        <br>Leaving room for heartbreak, minor chance for failure
        <br>Catastrophic and complete, comatose and cold
        <br>But think not to that, that thought, that
        <br>
        <br>Will you pause that twirl for just a moment
        <br>Just a moment to see
        <br>And scan your eye across the table
        <br>Just a moment to see
        <br>
        <br>There's an ocean of comfort in those lost seconds
        <br>Where blue meets green
        <br>What is captured, quickly released
        <br>No cage, bars lifted, wind quickened
        <br>
        <br>Will you share this moment with me
        <br>A desert dream
        <br>Unequivocal and hardly conceived, but
        <br>Just a moment, with me

        <h2>Trash day</h2>

        Loose strings of blue, wound tight against my hand
        <br>Constricting and restricting, bandaged, and planned
        <br>I swing open the door to humid air
        <br>Another world, wind rustling, quiet dampness
        <br>Swing past the dripping gutter, the depression of pavement
        <br>Round the red Prius, sunburnt and peeling
        <br>To the oasis of a nook, a holding pattern
        <br>A receptacle, to take away the clutter
        <br>There is a brief interlude, a respite, a space to escape
        <br>For nothing need be said, a tear easily shed
        <br>In this dark trash corner of mine
        <br>Swing the lid, release, the flow of blood touching the tips
        <br>And slam
        <br>The work is done, no reason to linger
        <br>Yet the quiet humid air beckons,
        <br>“Tell us secrets”

        Gently lifting my head turn
        <br>To the news, stocks dip,
        <br>Rub the dream from my eyes.
        <br>She's there again, walking away,
        <br>Purse pulled up, breath and courage.
        <br>She's still there, specter of morning light.
        <br>No need, no worry, the thoughts, just
        <br>Thoughts
        <br>But pull up, pull out, pull
        <br>This weight, the sour stomach cured with coffee
        <br>Pull up, pull out, put down
        <br>Those electrons
        <br>Swipe up, swipe down
        <br>Those thoughts of those
        <br>Not yours, not yours
        <br>I see it and she's gone, a door closed
        <br>A creak, an acknowledgment, a submission

        Curved glass, cold in hand

        <br>Little laughter in a pasta box
        <br>Separation by the partition, counter
        <br>Escape to a mirror, bathroom reflection
        <br>Long lines of sighs
        <br>Find me in the crowd
        <br>Hold my gaze a little while longer

        <br>Twisted hands, contorted face, hair pulling madness

        <br>So bury it in a tomb
        <br>Your sadness has no match
        <br>Print it to a banner
        <br>I will fight til I make ___ my ___
        <br>That is what I said, there, standing in that bathroom
        <br>That mirrored profile staring back at me, questioning, my friend and enemy, my ego mine
